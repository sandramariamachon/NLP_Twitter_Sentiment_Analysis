# _How's 2021 going? Twitter Sentiment AnalysisÂ (NLP)_

#### An NLP Data Science project to find out how people feel about 2021. Click [here](https://sandra-maria-machon.medium.com/hows-2021-going-twitter-sentiment-analysis-nlp-e62e4e8f3767) for the article
This project used Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyse users' sentiment towards 2021. After 2020 turned out to be a disaster, we've all been looking forward to 2021 with hope. I decided to perform a Twitter Sentiment Analysis to find out if the new year is treating us well! I scraped 37,621 tweets using the following search queries:
- "2021 is"
- "2021 will"
- "This year"

The tools used include ***Tweepy*** (for mining tweets), ***Pandas*** (for data cleaning/wrangling), ***Tweet Preprocessor*** (for rapid tweet cleaning), ***NLTK*** (for tokenization, stopwords removal and POS tagging), ***Plotly***, ***Matplotlib*** and ***Word Cloud*** (for visualization).

With this project I wanted to get familiar with the Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and answer the following questions:

- ***What are the most common words people use to describe 2021?***
- ***What is the number of tweets with positive, negative and neutral sentiment?***
- ***What are the most common words used in positive, neutral and negative tweets?***
- ***What are the most liked and retweeted posts?***
