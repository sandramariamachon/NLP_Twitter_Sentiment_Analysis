# _How's 2021 going? Twitter Sentiment Analysis (NLP)_

#### An NLP Data Science project to find out how people feel about 2021.Click [here](link) for article
This project used Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyse users' sentiment towards 2021.

The tools used include ***Tweepy*** (for mining tweets), ***Pandas*** (for data cleaning/wrangling), ***Tweet Preprocessor*** (for rapid tweet cleaning), ***NLTK*** (for tokenization, stopwords removal and POS tagging), ***Plotly***, ***Matplotlib*** and ***Word Cloud*** (for visualization).

With this project I wanted to get familiar with the Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and answer the following questions:

- What are the most common words people use to describe 2021?
- What is the number of tweets with the positive, negative and neutral sentiment?
- What are the most common words used in positive, neutral and negative tweets?
- What are the most liked and retweeted posts?

## Contents

In this repository you'll find:
- A notebook with a source code for the Twitter Sentiment Analysis
- A notebook with a source code for the Tweepy Twitter API scraper
- "Neon.ttf" font file which can be used to customise your Word Cloud visualisation
- "twitter.png" file which can be used as a mask for the Word Cloud to create a shape of Twitter logo

## Main Findings

With this project we learnt the following insights:
- "Good", "Best, "Happy", "Great" and "Bad" are the top 5 words used to describe 2021
